**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals this project is to detect lane line on the roads using OpenCV fo smooth navigation of driverless cars on the road.

### Pipeline

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps

1. Image were converted to grayscale image using cv2 library.

2. In order to make the image smooth, Gaussian Blur was applied to get better results. After this, Canny Edge detection
 algorithm was applied to detect extreme changes in the image.

3. As the Canny Edge Detection algorithm detects edges throughout the image, mask was then applied to the image to remove the edges that are not desired. Region of interest bounded with lane lines was defined to four on just the road the edges.

4. Next, Hough transformation was applied to convert all the pixels (edges) detected can be joined to create a line.

5. However, Hough Transformation could not detect gaps between broken lines. Hence, interpolation was done on these lines to create a joint line on both the sides of the image.

### 2. Potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

1. Does not perform well when the roads are curved, like in the challenge video. 

2. Wonâ€™t perform well on a bumpy road or when camera gets tilted because of hardcoded values.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

1. Lines detected could be more accurate. 

2. Could be curvier to detect the curves along the road.
